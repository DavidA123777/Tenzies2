## David Abushlaih Tenzies Game
This project utilizes concepts of passing props into components, useState, and using useEffect to keep two different pieces of state in sync when the game is won. I modified this project from a React course on Scrimba in which I added functionality to keep a counter of the number of rolls each user takes and outputs that number when they win. This project utilizes React.js and CSS
